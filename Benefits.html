				<p><h2>One of the best reasons for kids and adults to play sport is for the incredible health benefits. With experts recommending 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, it can be hard to find the time and motivation to fit this into a busy schedule. Sport makes it easy. Firstly, the sport tends to involve vigorous exercise, meaning you only need to aim for 75 minutes a week to get the same benefits. This makes achieving a healthy level of exercise easier.</h2></p>
				<br>
				<p><h2>Secondly, the sport is fun. Everyone can find a physical activity that gets them excited, whether that’s volleyball, cycling, kayaking, or rock climbing. The vast range of sports available means that it’s possible to find a form of exercise that’s enjoyable. Once again, this makes exercise exciting and less of a chore, increasing the chances of you finding the motivation to do it.</h2></p>

				<h3>Neurological Benefits</h3>
				<p>In terms of physical changes in the brain, sport releases dopamine and serotonin. As a result, your risk of depression is reduced by up to 30%! These so-called happiness chemicals are essential for a stable and positive mood. Any form of exercise stimulates their production but sport seems to do so more effectively, especially when you score a goal or win a game. As sport is often practiced outdoors, you’ll also be receiving more vitamin D. This too has been shown to improve mood and lower the symptoms of depression. Taking vitamin D tablets can be used as a treatment for depression but getting it directly from the sun is a more natural and effective method.</p>

				<h2>Psychological Benefits</h2>
				<p>It’s not just depression that’s reduced when you try sports. Through releasing tension and increasing mental energy, you’ll likely find that your anxiety levels are lowered as well. Part of this comes from the feeling of being in the zone; that almost meditative state when you’re completely grounded in the present and focused on the task at hand. Even conditions like ADHD can be improved through sport. Despite being essentially physical, there’s a great deal of mental concentration needed to participate. Sports players are constantly making decisions, communicating with others, and watching fast-paced action. This improves focus and memory retention. If you’re wary about taking ADHD medication, then doing sport can have much the same effect. Furthermore, sport is incredible for your sense of self-worth. Each day that you have a game, you’ve given your life a purpose. The aim is clear: score more points than the other team. When you win, this sense of achievement builds confidence. When you lose, you’re learning about resilience. It’s the competitive nature of sport that has wonderful psychological benefits for your wellbeing.</p>

				<h3>Improved Social Skills</h3>
				<p>Unlike other forms of exercise, sport is necessarily social. Even when you’re playing a solo sport, you’ll have a competitor, coach, and referee to interact with. For many people in the modern world, social interaction is lacking. Sport could be you’re way into making friends and reaping all the benefits that come with that. Outside of physical health, relationships are the most important foundation of happiness. Team sports are particularly good for building social prowess. Whether you’re a socially awkward adult or want your child to improve their interpersonal skills, team games are one of the best tools for achieving this. They require a deeper level of communication. You can’t pass a soccer ball through to a player without knowing where they plan to run. Being able to communicate this maneuver in the few seconds available requires active listening and the ability to read body language. This is a skill that is useful in everyday life but best learned on the sports field.</p>
