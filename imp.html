				<p><h2>From the moment they start school, a child should be exposed to sport. This will begin as play for a young child in elementary school. By college, however, this can be a serious and vital component of a young person’s life. For college athletes, sport provides meaning and a potential career path. It should therefore be fostered and encouraged, with gym class given the importance it deserves.</h2></p>

				<h3>Building Friendship Among Pupils</h3>
				<p>Kids in schools need to be able to get along with their fellow pupils. They’ll spend years of their lives with the same people, confined to classrooms, and cooperating on group tasks. Teachers, therefore, need to find a way to foster friendship between students. Sport is a great way to do this, as children play together. Through play, friendships are strengthened and classroom environments are calmer and more pleasant.</p>

				<h3>Healthy Kids are Better Learners</h3>
				<p>Physical exercise boosts mental energy, memory retention, and concentration. As a result, children who get a few minutes of exercise each day perform better in the classroom. They’re less likely to get distracted and will take in information more quickly. This allows them to get through the course material more quickly and achieve better results in exams. Don’t think of gym class as taking time away from more academic subjects but rather as supporting them.</p>

				<h3>Improving Problem Solving Skills</h3>
				<p>In addition to healthy children performing better at school, athletic children are great problem solvers. That’s essentially what a sports game is! Kids must find a way to outwit the opposition to win the match. For the duration of the game, players are solving problems. They must decide whether to shoot or pass, whether to play an offside trap or defend the goal line, or whether to play it safe or take a risk. The more they play, the more they’ll have learned from their mistakes to be better problem solvers. These skills can then be taken into algebra, chemistry, and literature classes.</p>

				<h3>Instilling Core Values</h3>
				<p>Sport teaches values that are essential to daily life. Respect for the opposition is needed when entering the grown-up world of politics or having disagreements with a romantic partner. Discipline helps children to learn that hard work gets the best long-term results. Resilience prepares students for the inevitable rejection of the job market. Finally, sport promotes humility in defeat which helps children to deal with life problems as they arise with grace and decorum.</p>
